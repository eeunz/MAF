# MAF

MSIT AI Fair (MAF) is a bias mitigation framework based on aif360 that can detect and mitigate biases in machine learning models. It contains the basic features of AIF360, and it is being expanded by adding a bias mitigation algorithm developed by the consortium. The MAF package is available in Python.

# MAF package includes
1. ddf
2. dfsd
3. f4sfds


We developed the package with scalability in mind. This library is still under development. We recommend contributions from metrics, descriptors, and deflection elimination algorithms.

# Supported bias mitigation algorithms
1. Fairness VAE
2. Fair feature distillation
3. Learning from fairness
4. Kernel density estimation
5. FairBatch

# Algorithms to add
1.  Classifier-projection regularization
2.  GAN2GAN
3.  FBI-Denoiser
4.  Manifold-PCA


# Supported fairness metrics
* Error rate	
* Average odds difference
* Average abs odds difference
* Selection rate	
* Disparate impact
* Statistical parity difference
* Generalized entropy index
* Theil index
* Equal opportunity difference
